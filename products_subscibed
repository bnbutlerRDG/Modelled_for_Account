-- Step 1: Extract active contracts where the contract is currently valid
WITH active_contracts AS (
    SELECT 
        SAFE_CAST(`Buyer BPID` AS STRING) AS Consumer_BPID,  -- Convert BPID to STRING for joins
        `Product Series Code` AS Product_Series_Code,  -- Use series code to avoid duplication
        `Data Product Name` AS Data_Product_Name,  -- Retain product name for filtering
        `Contract Start Date` AS Contract_Start_Date,  
        `Contract Expiry Date` AS Contract_Expiry_Date  
    FROM `rdmga4.RDMreports.contracts`
    WHERE CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN `Contract Start Date` AND `Contract Expiry Date`
),

-- Step 2: Extract consumer organization details
consumer_info AS (
    SELECT 
        SAFE_CAST(BPID AS STRING) AS consumer_id,  
        `Organization Name` AS consumer_name  
    FROM `rdmga4.RDMreports.raw_organization_overview`
),

-- Step 3: Extract product details while ensuring we only use the `Product Series Code`
product_info AS (
    SELECT 
        `Product Series Code` AS Product_Series_Code,  
        `Data Product Name` AS Data_Product_Name  
    FROM `rdmga4.RDMreports.raw_data_product_details`
    GROUP BY `Product Series Code`, `Data Product Name`
),

-- Step 4: Deduplicate data by keeping only one Product Series Code per Data Product Name per Consumer
deduplicated_data AS (
    SELECT 
        ac.Consumer_BPID,
        ac.Data_Product_Name,
        ac.Product_Series_Code,
        ac.Contract_Start_Date,
        ac.Contract_Expiry_Date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY ac.Consumer_BPID, ac.Data_Product_Name 
            ORDER BY ac.Contract_Start_Date DESC  -- Prioritize the most recent contract
        ) AS row_num
    FROM active_contracts ac
)

-- Step 5: Final selection, ensuring only one product series per consumer and product name
SELECT 
    ci.consumer_id AS pds_consumer_id,  
    ci.consumer_name AS pds_consumer_name,  
    dd.Product_Series_Code AS pds_product_series_code,  
    dd.Data_Product_Name AS pds_data_product_name,  
    dd.Contract_Start_Date AS pds_contract_start_date,  
    dd.Contract_Expiry_Date AS pds_contract_expiry_date  
FROM deduplicated_data dd
JOIN consumer_info ci 
    ON dd.Consumer_BPID = ci.consumer_id  
JOIN product_info pi
    ON dd.Product_Series_Code = pi.Product_Series_Code  
    AND dd.Data_Product_Name = pi.Data_Product_Name  -- Ensuring we map correctly
WHERE dd.row_num = 1;  -- Only keep one product series per consumer-product combination
